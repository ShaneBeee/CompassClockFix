# CompassClockFix
A simple resource pack to fix compass/clock items from not acting properly outside the overworld.

As of Minecraft 1.21.4, compasses and clocks are controlled a bit more in the resource pack.  
Compasses will only point to spawn in the default overworld, all other dimensions (custom or vanilla) will spin like crazy.  
Clocks are similar, they will spin randomly in other dimensions outside the overworld.  
This can become troublesome if you have custom dimensions.

This pack simply changes the items so they work in any dimension that is not the end or nether.

## BUILDING:
- To build the pack run `./gradlew resourcepack`

This will output to the `build/libs` folder.

## DOWNLOAD:
